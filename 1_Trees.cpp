// basically there are two types of data structure:-
// one is the basic data structure eg. array and LL. It changes how data is stored in memory
// other is the one in which we add a layer of operations above the basic data structure and 
// use the data way we want it to use eg. stacks and queues. i.e  underlying data structure is basic one.
// eg. array/LL is the basic data structure used in Stacks/queues

// trees is the first kind of data structure. It changes how data is stored in memory.
// eg. of tree is file system in our computer.
// another example is position of posts in companies (organisational Posts)
// important (General Information) that a directory can have more directories in it. 
// But a file cannot have more directries/files in it.

// topmost node is called root node
// parent node and children node. Parent is the one holding the address of its lower node. 
// Children is the one whose address is being held by the parent node. i.e. directly below the parent node
// Descendants of a node are all the nodes below that node. 
// a node can store the addressess of multiple nodes
// siblings :- same parent
// leaf :- which doesn't have any child
